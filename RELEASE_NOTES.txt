RELEASE NOTES

14-Jul-2017: Versions of THINCARB-excel2010.xlsm **prior** to v8 (see the bottom right corner of the grey text box to check), and 
versions of THINCARB_py27_math.py / THINCARB_py3_math.py prior to this date, were computing an altitude-compensated EpCO2 value 
(column/variable L) but not actually implementing it in the calculation of the H2CO3 activity (column/variable Y). This is now fixed. 
Since the impact of altitude on EpCO2 is small anyway, the impact of this change on H2CO3 activity (and derived parameters) varies 
from negligible to tiny.
