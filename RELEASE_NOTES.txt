RELEASE NOTES

13-Mar-2018: A bug, which caused the bisection optimiser to misbehave, manifested itself when processing data with very small 
alkalinities (<1 uEq/L). The result was that the charge balance would decrease well below the tolerance and lead to division by 
zero errors. This has now been trapped. We have verified that the fix does not impact any of the outputs of the model.

14-Jul-2017: Versions of THINCARB-excel2010.xlsm **prior** to v8 (see the bottom right corner of the grey text box to check), and 
versions of THINCARB_py27_math.py / THINCARB_py3_math.py prior to this date, were computing an altitude-compensated EpCO2 value 
(column/variable L) but not actually implementing it in the calculation of the H2CO3 activity (column/variable Y). This is now fixed. 
Since the impact of altitude on EpCO2 is small anyway, the impact of this change on H2CO3 activity (and derived parameters) varies 
from negligible to tiny.
