  "body": "###What is THINCARB?\r\n\r\nTHINCARB stands for THermodynamics of INorganic CARBon and is a computational model for estimating the excess partial pressure of CO2, and the equilibrium constants, activities, concentrations, and fractionation, of the hydroxyl and principal carbon-containing ions present in natural waters (ie, rivers and lakes) from basic water quality determinands.\r\n\r\nTHINCARB is not suitable for marine environments.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of THINCARB are the equations developed by Neal et al (1998) [1] and which have proved to be extremely useful. However, in the intervening years some minor corrections became apparent, and the platform on which that original model was deployed became obsolete! In addition, it was noted that there was a straightforward extension of the model that would also provide estimates of Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC) concentrations, something that is not routinely measured experimentally. So against this background it was decided to make a corrected, enhanced, model available to a new generation of water quality scientists. This enhanced model is THINCARB! [2]\r\n\r\nThe new DIC calculations have been validated using literature data and seem to provide quantitative agreement with experimental measurements except in samples having both low alkalinity and high levels of Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC).\r\n",
