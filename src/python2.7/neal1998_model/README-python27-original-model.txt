neal1998.py

This is the Python 2.7.x source code for an implementation of the original Neal et al (1998) Lotus 1-2-3 macro (see [1]). It does not calculate Total Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC) concentrations. Use the THINCARB model for that. This file is provided for reference purposes only. It can be opened and read using any ASCII-compatible text editor. Do not edit this file. Edit one of the call handler routines instead.



neal1998.pyc

(If present) This is the compiled byte code version of neal1998.py executed by the Python virtual machine.



call_neal1998_from_list.py

This is the Python 2.7.x source code for a handler routine to call neal1998.pyc using input values stored as Python list variables in the call handler itself. This file can be opened and read using any ASCII-compatible text editor. To utilise this file, edit in your own data between lines 11 - 36, and provide a name for the output file to contain the optimised values of EpCO2.



call_neal1998_from_file.py

This is the Python 2.7.x source code for a handler routine to call neal1998.pyc using input values stored in a separate input file. This file can be opened and read using any ASCII-compatible text editor. To utilise this file, edit it to provide the names of the input data file and the output file to contain the optimised values of EpCO2. Also match the variables A - G to the columns in the input data file.



neal1998_model_table5_test_data.txt

This is an example of an input data file to be used with call_neal1998_from_file.py. The date and time are dummy values.

IMPORTANT NOTE: the columns of data must be separated by a single space!



neal1998_model_results_from_calculation_LIST.txt

This is example output from executing call_neal1998_from_list.py



neal1998_model_results_from_calculation_FILE.txt

This is example output from executing call_neal1998_from_file.py
