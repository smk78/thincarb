To execute the the code in this folder you will need a Python 3.x.x interpreter.

If you do not have Python 3.x.x installed, go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download and install a version appropriate to your operating system.

Once Python is installed, the call handler routines may be executed from the command line using by specifying


   python call_THINCARB_py3_from_list.py

or

   python call_THINCARB_py3_from_file.py



NOTE

If you have multiple version of Python installed, you will need to ensure that you specifically call the Python 3.x.x interpreter, eg:

   c:\Python34\python.exe call_THINCARB_py3_from_list.py
