THINCARB-excel2010.xlsm

This is a Microsoft Excel Version 14.0 (Excel 2010) **macro-enabled** spreadsheet workbook containing a re-write of the original Neal et al (1998) Lotus 1-2-3 macro (see [1]) in Microsoft Visual Basic (VBA). This spreadsheet also extends the calculations to provide Total Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC) concentrations.  

The input values of pH, Alkalinity and Temperature provided in workbook correspond to those in Table 5 in [1]. Click the 'CommandB' button to activate the macro and thus optimise the value of EpCO2 by minimising the Charge Balance. You may then compare the estimates of EpCO2 with those shown in Table 5.
